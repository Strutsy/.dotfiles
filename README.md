# .dotfiles

Configuration files suited to my taste.

## Installation

```
cd .dotfiles/
./install
```

You can pass `-f` to `install` if you want to replace existing config files.

## Fonts, DPI, and autostart

- Fonts are changed in `~/.Xresources` and `~/.config/i3/config`
- DPI is changed in `~/.Xresources`
- `~/.autostart` is executed when i3 starts
